# Real-Time Human Pose Estimation with TensorFlow.js

## Overview

This project implements real-time human pose estimation directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js. It utilizes a pre-trained PoseNet model to detect and estimate human poses from images or webcam input.

## Features

- Real-time human pose estimation in the browser.
- Support for webcam input.
- Lightweight and efficient implementation using TensorFlow.js.

## Usage

- **Webcam Input**: The application will automatically detect and estimate poses from your webcam feed.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and on Node.js.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the TensorFlow.js PoseNet model. Special thanks to the TensorFlow team for providing the pre-trained model and resources.
